# Solidus Retail

[![Build Status][1]][2]

Sometimes online stores have point-of-sale operations as well. This extension
brings your e-commerce and brick-and-mortar together under one umbrella.

Installation
------------

Add solidus_retail to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_retail'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_retail:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_retail/factories'
```

Shopify doesn't allow sandbox environment. In order to run the specs locally you
would have to enter your own Shopify credentials else the spec suite will throw
you an error. 

In order to correctly run the spec suite of this gem, you must entered your own
Shopify credentials. Here are the keys that are required:

```ruby
SHOPIFY_PASSWORD=
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=
SHOPIFY_SHOP_NAME=
```
